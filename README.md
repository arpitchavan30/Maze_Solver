# Maze_Solver

I created a maze solver project using Java Swing and integrated the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. This software visually presents mazes and effectively uses the DFS algorithm for navigation and solving.

Highlighted Features:

1) Effortless Navigation: Using the DFS algorithm, the maze traversal efficiently uncovers a valid path from the starting point to the destination.

2) User-Friendly Interface: I designed an interactive GUI using Java Swing, which visually illustrates the maze, the path, and the step-by-step solution process.

3) Structured Maze Design: Employing a grid-based layout, the maze is intelligently represented with distinct cell values denoting walls, pathways, and the target point.

4) Clear Path Indication: The path is unmistakably highlighted using vibrant green cells, ensuring easy differentiation within the maze's structure.

This tool provides a visual representation of the solution process, allowing users to comprehend how the algorithm explores routes to achieve a solution.
